\title{Screening for partial conjunction hypotheses controlling
using the adaptive filtering procedures}
\description{
Provides the adaptive filtering multiple testing procedures
for partial conjunction (PC) hypotheses. The procedures can more efficiently reject non-null
partial conjunction hypotheses than previously methods
especially when the number of
candidate hypotheses is large while most of them are complete nulls
}
